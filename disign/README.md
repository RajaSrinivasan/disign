# disign - Utility to generate digital signatures and authenticate against them

## Background

This tool supports generation of digital signatures for files using the private/public keypair generated by sshkeygen. Typically
these are $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa and $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

For each file the signature file named by adding ".sig" to the file name reside in the same directory.

## Usage

../../bin/disign help
Generate a cyrptographic signature of a file.
  
  The signature is generated using the private part of the keypair. 
  
  For verification, the public part of the keypair is used. 
  
  File naming convention:

  The signature file is named <basename>.sig 

  disign sign --private id_rsa file1, ...
  disign authenticate --public id_rsa.pub file1, file2, ...

  The signature files and the base files are in the same folder

Usage:
  disign [command]

Available Commands:
  authenticate Verifies the signature file
  help         Help about any command
  sign         Digitally sign the files
  version      A brief description of your command

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for disign
  -v, --verbose   verbose output

Use "disign [command] --help" for more information about a command.
